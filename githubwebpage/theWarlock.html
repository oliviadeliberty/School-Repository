      <h1>72 Hour Survival Game</h1>
      <h2>It's happening. You need to prepare.</h2>
    </header>
    <content>
      <p>You have 10 minutes to grab whatever you can and then get out of town. The roads are completely blocked off and you'll have to travel on foot. You'll need items to help you survive at least 72 hours - approximately the time it will take to reach your planned shelter, which is 90 miles away (walking speed at 3mph x 10 hours a day).</p>
      <p>You can only travel <b>10</b> hours per day. The remaining 14 hours a day must be used to camp, eat, and rest.</p>
      <p>You can only carry <b>20lbs</b> in your pack at your current speed</p>
      <p><b>Added items reduce your speed .5 mph for every 5lbs.</b> (always round to the nearest 5lbs)</p>
      <p><b>You must take at least 2 items from each required category, and as much or little from the optional category as you like.</b> Remember, the weight adds up fast!</p>
      <p>If you reach your destination in 72 hours, you automatically get 10 survival points.</p>
      <p>If it takes you longer than 72 hours, your survival rating decreases 1 point for every 5 hours.</p>
      <p><b>Bonus:</b> Any items which help your long term survival carry a survival rating boast and some contain penalties. </p>
